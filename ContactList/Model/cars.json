The two motors installed at the front provide 300 CV directly to the front wheels, while the third acts as a generator and is installed on the dual-clutch gearbox. In the combined cycle, the Asterion adds the power from these motors to that of the internal combustion engine, providing the vehicle with an incredible 910 CV permanent all-wheel drive! The lithium-ion batteries, on the other hand, are located below the center console for greater safety in the event of an accident, with the benefit of lowering the center of gravity. ",

Comically fast, the front-mounted V-12 sings the maker’s siren song as conducted by the driver’s right foot whenever the mood strikes. If that sounds a bit dramatic, it is, but the 812’s purity of purpose and design are that inspiring. Part of that charm is how civil it can be for nights on the town even as neck-straining acceleration remains just an accelerator stab away. While Ferrari isn’t fond of us strapping our test gear to its products, we were able to clock a 2.7-second 60-mph run back in 2018 in the GTS’s coupe version, then called the Superfast. It hit 100 mph in 5.7 seconds and destroyed the quarter-mile in 10.4 seconds at 138 mph. Superfast indeed. That same 6.5-liter V-12 is found under the hood of the 2024 812 GTS convertible—the only body style available for this model year. Any doubts regarding the 812’s supercar bandwidth were quelled with our drive of the 2021 Ferrari 812 GTS, where we came away deeming it “two cars in one.” Buyers fortunate enough to land a 2024 812 GTS are also joining an elite club, as the 812 will very likely be the last naturally aspirated V-12 Ferrari sports car without hybrid assist.

On the Nineties F355, you could have a GTB, a GTS or a Spider. That glorious machine was replaced by the 360 Modena, whose Spider version had a canvas soft-top and slightly awkward styling, as did the follow-up F430 (it was prettier, though). Since 2011’s 458 Italia Spider, open Ferraris have had a retractable aluminium roof, ingeniously packaged conduits for high-speed hedonism without compromising on structural integrity. That’s exactly the deal with the 296 GTS, the first road-going Ferrari, erm, Spider to use a six-cylinder engine. If you discount the Dino GTS, which isn’t technically a Ferrari.

England now has a convincing answer to a Ferrari grand touring car, and on first inspection, Aston might well have surpassed this incredibly high standard. Aston Martin claims the DB12 is “the world’s first super-tourer”, whatever that might mean. Either way, the British brand also claims that 80 per cent of the DB12 is new, and that this 202mph, £185,000, 671bhp coupé represents a brand-new era for the company. It’s an era that’s being crafted by Aston’s boss, Lawrence Stroll, with a newly restructured team beneath him, and a fresh chunk of investment behind them that will (hopefully) allow Britain’s most famous sports car company to flourish once again, having been in the wilderness recently. So can Aston and its new DB12 deliver on the promise and self-confidence? The car looks the bees-knees in the flesh – and it also appears pretty tasty on paper. It is powered by a now-familiar AMG-sourced 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine which has been tuned by Aston to develop 671bhp and a thumping 800Nm.

The Valour's spectacular styling is the work of a team led by Miles Nurnberger, Aston's director of design and the man who also created the very different CC100 which Aston created to celebrate its 100th anniversary. While the CC100 was a barely-there speedster, the Valour is a muscular coupe, one with a design that draws obvious influence from the square-rigged V8 Vantage that Aston produced between 1977 and 1989. It also bears a striking resemblance to the one-off Victor that Aston Martin's Q division created in 2020, which was based on the track-only One-77.",

        "carDescription": "The 2024 Aston Martin Valhalla will be a mid-engine hypercar with a hybrid powertrain in the vein of the Ferrari SF90. The Aston's exterior boasts an exaggerated version of the company's grille along with slippery bodywork and a carbon-fiber engine cover. Carbon fiber also makes up its central tub, and the Valhalla's exotic nature will be further accentuated by its dihedral doors. Power comes from a twin-turbo V-8 (sourced from Mercedes-AMG) and a plug-in-hybrid system that together generates 937 horsepower. Aston estimates a top speed of 217 mph and a 2.5-second zero-to-62-mph time. The 2022 Valhalla will also have an EV mode, albeit with a very short all-electric range.",

        "carDescription": "Aston Martin is a British brand that's synonymous with opulence, but this automaker has never had a hypercar to call its own. That changes with the launch of the Valkyrie, an aerodynamic, performance-themed speed demon that holds the distinction of being Aston Martin's first entry in the hypercar war. Aston's vehicles are typically marked by their elegant, somewhat restrained design, but the Valkyrie blazes a fresh path with its over-the-top styling. This is the type of car that looks like it would be right at home on a future-world racetrack or in the next Transformers movie. The Valkyrie's hybrid V-12 powertrain produces a staggering 1139 horsepower, and our time piloting it at the Bahrain International Circuit left us thinking that this is a machine beyond mere numbers, however impressive the claimed 2.5-second zero-to-60-mph time and electronically limited 220-mph top speed sound. Pricing starts at about $3.5 million, and production is extremely limited.",

Finished in an eye-catching dark green, yellow and black livery, probably one of the best in F1, the car wears sponsorship from Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil company, and Cognizant, an American IT company. The AMR23 can be visually distinguished from last year's car by its larger mirrors and updated 2023-spec roll structure. However, Technical Director Dan Fallows said at the reveal that around two-thirds of the car would continue to evolve as the season progressed. ",

Along with being practical, spacious, and upscale, Jaguar’s two-row mid-sizer will excite driving enthusiasts. A standard 246-hp turbo four-cylinder is fine and dandy, but the available 395-hp turbocharged and supercharged 3.0-liter inline-six is a fiery alternative. The 550-hp F-Pace SVR has the highest performance, but we review it separately. The trade-off for the regular F-Pace’s fun-to-drive demeanor is a firm ride that might not suit everyone. The cabin is appropriately posh, with quality materials throughout and modern tech smartly integrated into the design. A large touchscreen infotainment system sits above the dash and runs Jaguar’s latest software. Too bad it’s a work in progress and is plagued by some bugs. While those type of small issues make it a harder sell versus more polished rivals, the 2023 F-Pace’s driving verve is charming enough to outweigh those demerits.",

Those in the market for something that's extra roomy, extra zoomy, or extra efficient are looking in the wrong place, though; the E-Pace is one of the most expensive vehicles in its segment despite being less fuel-efficient and less spacious than most of its peers—which include the BMW X2 and Volvo XC40. Those who do opt for the E-Pace are limited to just one flavor, as the small SUV is now only offered in a one-size-fits-all model.",

But the I-Pace is an automobile that speaks to the heart more so than the mind. Its enticing driving demeanor, distinct exterior design, and refined interior keep this Jag in the mix. Technological features—such as a Meridian sound system, 10-inch infotainment display, driver-assistance features, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto—complete the package. While the Jag might not place very high in our 2023 rankings it’s still a very pleasant vehicle.",

Its cabin is snug and lined with quality materials but its design and features haven’t been updated in a while. Convertible models come with a power-operated soft-top that tucks neatly in the trunk—top-down it’s gorgeous—but the coupe is beautiful too, and its additional cargo space is more practical. Either way, the F-type is one of the best-looking sports cars, handsome enough to dress up any driveway and aggressive enough to make driving a joy.",

Meanwhile, the XF P250 comes standard with rear-wheel drive, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and a 246-hp turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The P300 version boosts output to 296 hp and is strictly an all-wheel-drive model. While the XF’s powertrain offerings are limited in size and power, its price makes it the most affordable entry in the mid-size-luxury-car segment. Its interior features handsome materials has plenty of tech, and the XF combines the plushness and ride of a big sedan with surefooted handling. Its maneuverability at reasonable speeds is downright catlike. Unfortunately, it’s not enough; this feline is clearly showing its age.",

Not long after, news outlets reported that the Noire had been purchased by an unnamed buyer for the highest new-car price ever — $18.7 million. So far, the identity of the buyer remains a mystery. We think that’s only fitting, as this rare souper-coupe has more in common with the Batmobile than luxury legends like the Rolls-Royce Phantom or the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport. Interest in the Bugatti La Voiture Noire was so intense following the concept reveal in early 2019 that Bugatti decided to make 20 “budget” Noire versions. Based on the Bugatti Chiron model, they’re priced at $3.3 million each. That’s about ⅙ the original Bugatti La Voiture Noire price. The new edition is available in Élégance or Sportive trims, and should arrive by mid 2020.",

The Chiron's cabin is just as artfully designed as its exterior, and it coddles occupants in fine materials that help justify its price tag. But let's be honest, people are really paying for the performance here. Those looking for modern conveniences (think Apple CarPlay) or driver-assistance tech, they won't find them here, but after driving this monster, they likely won't care about such minor drawbacks.",

True to form, the French automaker has put a cap on production: It will build only 40 examples of the Divo, all of which have been spoken for. Compared with the Chiron, the Divo's key enhancements include an upgraded suspension, additional weight savings, and all kinds of aerodynamic wizardry. While both Bugatti models look outrageous, it's not difficult to tell them apart: If it has a dorsal fin, a carved-up hood, and cheese-grater taillights under an enormous wing, you're looking at the Divo.",
